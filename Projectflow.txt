1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
    #pip install pandas
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
    # pip install dvc
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do (creates a new S3 directory)
    #mkdir S3" 
6. Now we do 
    #dvc remote add -d myremote S3
7. Next #
    dvc add data/ 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
9. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
10. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
12. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
13. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
14. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.git
